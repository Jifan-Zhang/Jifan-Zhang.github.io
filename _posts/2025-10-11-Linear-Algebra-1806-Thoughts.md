# 前言

本科毕业6年, 前一阵子读paper发现, 线性代数知识点忘了很多, 想着有必要抽空把线代知识复习巩固一下. 问了好几个朋友, 哪个网课线性代数讲的好? 呼声最高的是MIT Gilbert Strang教授的[18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/resources/lecture-34-final-course-review/)网课. 正好8月份有时间, 花了两个月时间, 断断续续把线性代数课视频听完了. 今天听完最后一节, 感觉意犹未尽. 教授讲的非常不错.



# 对18.06的思考

**18.06好在哪?**

- 课程结构: 18.06 一节课45分钟左右, 跟90分钟的大课相比, 学生注意力(至少对我来说)能更集中些.

- 逻辑顺序: 听课你就能感觉到, 他的内容、逻辑顺序是特别安排过的. 很多数学教材书里就做不到. 经常是简单堆叠知识点, 你要是按章节看教材, 逻辑顺序就不太连贯. 但18.06的课程内容有结构并且形成了闭环, 比如SVD是总结了之前全部内容. 

- 讲课思路: 我觉得这是最重要的. Gilbert Strang教授讲课以理解为主, **他会以提问的方式引导你、告诉你他是怎么想的.** 这非常宝贵. 我从本科到研究生, 没看到几个教授用这种方式. 课上用的结论证明提供完整思路, 和简明的证明. 正如教授课上所说: “我课上很少用Proof”. 

  > 我本科在华南理工大学. 对比我本科的线性代数, 本科的线性代数课偏理论和证明 (很好的继承了苏式教育的特性), 一堂课知识点密度巨高: 前1/3到1/2讲定义和性质, 之后就是各种例题、推导、证明, 非常烧脑! 一堂课下来, 能感觉到室内气温显著上升!). 😂 
  >
  > 本科课非常枯燥, 一板书全是证明! 但学霸学好了无敌. 如果要我对比, 我觉得对于大一新生来说, 听18.06是更好. 我本科的课更适合现在的我复习用.

- 结合应用: 很多知识点, 教授会告诉你这个理论在工业界目前怎么用到的. 比如讲了JPEG的图片压缩用到了换基, 他会给你解释为什么用傅立叶基、Wavelet基, 而不用标准基, 等等. 

- 另外录课程视频的摄影师大哥很专业了, 镜头紧跟着老师板书.👍

**缺点?**

- 才34节课, 够谁看的?? 😂







###### [中文](#前言)

# Preface

It’s been six years since I graduated from college. Recently, while reading some research papers, I realized that I’d forgotten a lot of linear algebra. So I decided to take some time to review and refresh my knowledge.

After asking a few friends which online linear algebra course they thought was the best, the most recommended one was **MIT’s 18.06 Linear Algebra** by Professor **Gilbert Strang** ([link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/resources/lecture-34-final-course-review/)).

Luckily, I had some free time in August, so I spent about two months—on and off—watching the entire course. Today, I finally finished the last lecture, and honestly, I wish there were more! The professor’s teaching was *fantastic*.

# Thoughts on 18.06

**What makes 18.06 great?**

- **Course structure:**
  Each lecture is around 45 minutes long, which helps me stay focused better than a typical 90-minute class.

- **Logical flow:**
  You can immediately feel that the course content and sequence were *carefully designed*. Many math textbooks don’t do this — they simply stack concepts together, and when you read chapter by chapter, the logic feels disjointed.
  In contrast, 18.06’s content is cohesive and forms a complete circle — for example, the **SVD** lecture ties together everything learned earlier.

- **Teaching philosophy:**
  I think this is the most important part. Professor Strang emphasizes *understanding*.
  **He teaches by asking questions — showing you how he thinks.** That’s incredibly valuable. From my undergraduate through graduate studies, I’ve rarely seen professors teach this way.
  The course balances intuition and rigor — offering just enough proofs to make the logic clear, without overwhelming the learner. As Strang said in class: *“I rarely use `proof` word in my lectures.”*

  > I did my undergrad at **South China University of Technology**. Compared to that, my undergrad linear algebra course was much more theoretical and proof-heavy — a very “Soviet-style” math course.
  >
  > The knowledge density was insane (in a good way): the first half was all definitions and properties; the second half was non-stop derivations and proofs. It was *mentally exhausting*! You could literally feel the classroom temperature rising during lectures. 😂
  >
  > It was extremely dry — the whole blackboard was filled with proofs! But those who mastered it were unbeatable.
  >
  > If I compare now, I’d say **18.06** is much better for *freshmen*, while my undergrad course is better suited for *reviewing* now, for me as a graduate.

- **Connection to real-world applications:**
  Professor Strang often explains how these mathematical ideas are used in real life.
  For instance, when discussing JPEG image compression, he explained why we use **Fourier** or **wavelet** bases instead of the standard basis — and how that’s related to changing coordinate systems.

- **And the cameraman deserves credit too!**
  The board writing is always perfectly captured. 👍

**Any downsides?**

- Only 34 lectures... not nearly enough! 😂
